            <p><u>Other names</u>: Ecuador Palora<br><u>Pollination</u>: <a href="../how-to-grow/pollination-and-harvest/pollination-and-harvest.html">self-fertile</a></p>
            <p>For many years, it was my dream to grow this variety here in Western Australia. I’d even designed <a href="../more/origami/origami.html">origami models</a> of it in anticipation of that special day, if it ever came, that I might hold one of these fruit in my hot little hands. Luckily, someone else shared this same dream, and I purchased a grafted specimen which used the material from a seedling he had grown. I can’t say it has quite yet lived up to its expectations, though it is certainly an improvement on the four years it took <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a> to fruit! It is essentially a more vigorous and sun-tolerant version of this variety, with (hopefully in time) bigger fruit. The branches are wider and less 'wavy' which I find very attractive and unique. Thus, it is easy to tell the two apart from the plant alone. Definitely worth having if you’ve got a sweet tooth, and it fruits over the winter when most of the other dragons are dormant.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>Palora buds are much like <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a> buds, though the outer sepals (technically tepals) open up slightly more. This variety is supposed to be much quicker from bud to fruit, though considering I have only had flowers in autumn this difference was not noticeable. I find megalanthus buds a really cool thing to have in the garden as they snake their way to maturity.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Comparing to its 'inferior' cousin, Palora has flowers that are almost identical in shape, though a deeper yellow. The petals form a lovely bowl shape that is a magnet for bees, and the stigma is buried within the anthers as it usually is for self-fertile varieties. I would advice against using Palora pollen to cross pollinate other varieties due to its very different genetics (being in another genus), unless you are going for a new hybrid.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>Continuing the comparison, the fruit of Palora is actually quite different to <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a>, excepting the taste. The skin is a paler yellow, with fewer spines in a more geometric arrangement (which is what inspired me to create an <a href="../more/origami/origami.html">origami model</a>!). It is more rounded and perhaps more aesthetically pleasing. However, the taste is very hard to tell apart. Perhaps slightly less sweet, though still overwhelmingly sweet, with a honey aftertaste. A great treat on a hot day, and a natural laxative too so don’t eat too much!</p>
