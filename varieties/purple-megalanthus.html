            <p>Purple Megalanthus is one of the most sought-after dragon fruit varieties due to its stunning appearance, self-fertility, and great taste. The plant has much skinnier branches than most varieties, with thorns that don’t match up on
              adjacent ribs. This
              makes the plant look quite unique, if a little spindly. Despite its skinny branches, Purple Megalanthus still produces fruit of a reasonable size on its own pollen, unlike <a href="../varieties/sugar-dragon.html">Sugar Dragon</a> and <a
                href="../varieties/malaysian-purple.html">Malaysian Purple</a> which have far thicker branches. I find this quite interesting as it seems counter-intuitive. Nevertheless, they are all great varieties to have in your garden, and
              Purple Megalanthus especially is one of the most visually appealing.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>This variety is one of the first to bud, alongside the setaceus varieties (e.g., <a href="../varieties/sugar-dragon.html">Sugar Dragon</a>, <a href="../varieties/malaysian-purple.html">Malaysian Purple</a>, and <a
                href="../varieties/pink-panther.html">Pink Panther</a>). This makes it a great choice if you are looking to extend your fruiting season. Buds start as pointy globules which quickly become a lime green with a faint
              red rim. Buds take a very typical time of around three weeks to mature and open.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Purple Megalanthus has a slightly different looking flower to most varieties. It is a little smaller than average and does not open as fully as most other varieties. Also, the stigmatic lobes (tentacle-like protrusions at the head of the
              stigma) are slightly smaller than average, and they also do not open as fully as you would expect. However, none of these characteristics hinder pollination assuming you have hand-pollinated correctly, or maybe even without.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>Purple Megalanthus produces nice, round fruit of a moderate size. Fruit development is perhaps a little slower than average, though not outrageously so by any stretch. I have only tasted several fruits so far, and I was a little
              underwhelmed by the flavour and texture. However, it was quite difficult to tell when they were ripe as the colour did not change past a dull red, and I believe the main reason for my disappointment was picking them too late. Next time
              I will pick the fruits a little earlier and hopefully they will live up to the hype.</p>
