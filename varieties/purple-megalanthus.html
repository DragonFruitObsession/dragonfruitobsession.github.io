            <p>I have read that this variety was developed in Australia, though I have a sneaking suspicion that it is merely a Desert King seedling grown in Australia. Regardless of its origin, this variety is absolutely delicious, perhaps the best I have ever eaten! The branches are typical of varieties with a megalanthus heritage, though thicker and more vigorous than <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a>. It is a fast grower and has outcompeted the two <a href="../varieties/palora.html">Palora</a> plants it is growing with in the same trellis. Sun tolerance is also above average which might be due to its Australian selection. There seems to be a lack of consensus surrounding the sterility of this variety, and I look forward to testing this for myself when I get more flowers, though for now I will assume it is self-sterile.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>Like most of the megalanthus varieties, Purple Megalanthus buds late in the season, around the start of autumn. Buds are similar to <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a>, though the outer sepals (technically tepals) pull back more, hinting at a possible setaceus heritage. The tepals are outlined in a vintage red and are stunning in themselves. The time from bud to flower is surprisingly standard given the mild conditions and relation to slower varieties.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>
            <p>Much like its buds, the flowers of Purple Megalanthus are reminiscent of <a href="../varieties/yellow-colombiana.html">Yellow Colombiana</a> with their bowl shape, though less pronounced. Basically, a mix between megalanthus and (possibly) setaceus traits. The stigma is not far from the anthers, indicating that there may be some self-fertility. The flowers close up quickly the next morning despite the cooler temperatures.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>I have only had one fruit so far, but boy was it a ripper! After waiting around half a year for it to slowly ripen over the winter, I decided that the colour was not going to get any more intense and picked the precious egg. There were a few spines near the base of the fruit, though they brushed off easily. One bite and I knew I had nailed the timing. Sweet like candy, but with <a href="../varieties/sugar-dragon.html">Sugar Dragon</a> vibes and complexity of flavour. This variety takes the best parts of its parents, whomever they may be.</p>
