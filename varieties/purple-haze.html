            <p>Purple Haze is one of the hybrids created by the legendary Paul Thomson in his first batch of seedlings where he crossed Neitzel, a white-fleshed variety, with Rixford, a red-fleshed variety. This is the fifth seedling and is one of
              the most sought after dragon fruit varieties, despite its self-sterility. What makes it so popular is a combination of its size, appearance, and taste. The fruit is huge, with some growers reporting up to a kilogram, and the inside is a
              stunning, vibrant purple with a sweet grape-like flavour that is just a pleasure to eat. I also find the plant especially attractive with its huge meaty stems and well-defined rib. It is a prolific grower.

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>This variety buds reasonably early, though late enough to allow time for even earlier varieties, such as <a href="../varieties/sugar-dragon.html">Sugar Dragon</a>, to provide a pollen source. The buds start off with a yellow tinge
              before progressing in a typical fashion. One unique trait is that the buds are especially plump, particularly when they are about to open as can be seen in the rightmost picture.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>
            <p>The flowers of Purple Haze are typical of self-sterile varieties, with a stigma that protrudes well away from the anthers. However, the flowers donâ€™t seem to open as grandly as other varieties like <a
                href="../varieties/colombian-supreme.html">Colombian Supreme</a>, with the petals
              bending outwards only towards their tips. The outer sepals bend back much more dramatically. One interesting feature is that the stigma has split fronds, which would be interesting to compare to its parents and siblings.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>The fruits of Purple Haze are large from the start. Like the buds, even in the green stage they are nice and plump, with reasonably sized bracts and an awesome light green colour. As they mature, the fruits slowly begin to round out
              before developing a darkish purple colour on the outside that perfectly compliments the epic magenta they are hiding inside. I would highly recommend dedicating a trellis to this variety if you have another pollen source.</p>
