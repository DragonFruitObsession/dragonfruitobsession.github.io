            <p>Delight is one of the hybrids created by the legendary Paul Thomson in his first batch of seedlings in a cross between Neitzel, a white-fleshed variety, and Rixford, a red-fleshed variety. While he originally labelled it 3-S, it was
              the first he named due to its “superb” flavour. My first fruit was a bit of a disappointment, however, tasting quite sour and with an almost too-smooth texture. However, I believe this may have been a slightly deformed fruit as the
              flesh colour was pinker than I was expecting in comparison to its source. Delight should have a very faint pink flesh which I hope will come through in the proceeding fruit.
            </p>
            <p>The plant is extremely vigorous, perhaps the most vigorous of all my varieties thus far, quickly crowding out the other varieties around it. However, it still suffers in extreme heat like most varieties.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>
            <p>The buds of delight start off as little yellow droplets, so bright that the intersection of the sepals is almost invisible. As the buds grow, they slowly lose this yellow colour in favour of a browner tinge, before finally turning
              fully green and opening up. This process takes a very typical amount of time of approximately three weeks.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>My first few Delight flowers did not open up like normal, with the petals remaining slightly folded back on themselves. This deformity is perhaps somewhat related to the unusually pink flesh the fruit resulted in. One thing I noted
              about the flowers was that despite this deformity, they still seemed very large and robust.</p>
            <p>While some people claim Delight is self-fertile, the majority find this not to be the case, and Paul Thomson himself says it self-sterile. Unless you want to experiment, make sure to cross pollinate.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>
            <p>The ripening process for Delight was very typical until the point of ripening, when colour change was slow, and it was difficult to determine ripeness. The flesh became very soft, very quickly, though the fruit never appeared fully
              ripe nor tasted fully ripe. Hopefully the coming fruit are a better representation of Delight.</p>
