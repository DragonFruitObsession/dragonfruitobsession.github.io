            <p>This is the first variety of dragon fruit I ever collected, and so holds a special place in my heart as it was what started me on this obsession! As can probably be inferred from the name, this variety is one of a selection of dragon
              fruit cultivars originally from Vietnam. Due to its nice sweetness and oval shape, I have a hunch that this is the ‘Pearl’ cultivar. There is a real stigma about white dragon fruit tasting terrible, but this mostly comes from commercial
              growers harvesting dragon fruit too early. However, there are some terrible white varieties out there, some of which I have grown all the way to fruition only to rip out in disgust, so make sure you buy from a reputable
              seller.<br><br>This variety is an average grower and is reasonably tolerant of both the heat and the cold.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>In my experience, this variety buds from early December (early summer) to late February, and takes a few years before reaching full production. Buds are typically a pale-yellow colour when they first emerge and look like little
              droplets. After a few days they will develop a light green colour which they retain throughout maturity.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>Vietnam White has a beautiful, large flower, with a stigma stuck in its anthers. This allows it to set fruit on its own with little effect on fruit size, making it a beginner friendly choice. It even managed to self-pollinate through
              light rain, which will hinder most varieties as the rain washes away much of the pollen and the moisture lowers its viability.<br><br>Vietnam White is a good source of pollen for other white varieties such as Isis Gold due to it often
              flowering on the
              same or similar nights. However, it does not produce pollen to the extent of <a href="../varieties/common-red.html">Common Red</a>.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>My first few seasons of Vietnam White fruit were minimal, but the fruit were all above half a kilogram, with one – my biggest dragon fruit to date – weighing in at 993 grams. With a rise in buds in the following seasons, about half of
              the fruit stayed a similar size while the rest dropped to around the 250-gram mark. This is interesting when compared to other varieties in which all fruits dropped in size with more buds.<br><br>This variety is difficult to pick at
              peak ripeness due to its long time in the pink stage. Too soon and it's sour; too late and the seeds sprout inside the fruit, the sweetness drops, and the texture becomes less smooth, often splitting. I have found that about a week and
              a
              half after fully changing colour is ideal in summer, and a bit longer when it cools down. When you get it right it’s a real joy to eat.</p>
