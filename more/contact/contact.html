    <p>If for any reason you want to contact me - Sam Hesp - the creator of this website, feel free to send me an email at: “samuel.hesp7 (at) the standard Gmail ending”. I’m open to any comments, questions, criticisms or suggestions (please let me
      know if you find any broken links or typos). If you happen to
      live in or near Perth, Western Australia and would like some of my varieties, send me an email and we can discuss further (no deliveries). I usually have quite a few cuttings potted up and rooted for sale but can also sell ordinary cuttings. If there’s a
      picture
      of the variety up on the <a href="/">Home</a> page, there’s a good chance I’m ready to sell that variety, but there’s no harm in asking after the others (I may be able to spare a cutting or two). Alternatively, you can usually find me on <a
        href="https://www.gumtree.com.au/web/s-user/8204527152086" target="_blank">Gumtree</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100075787462531" target="_blank">Facebook Marketplace</a> during the warmer months.</p>
    <h2>Support the Website</h2>
    <p>The internet is full of misinformation and plagiarism, which I’ve seen firsthand with other websites plagiarising some of my content. I hope this website sets an example for others in terms of linking outside sources, and in terms of
      well-written and
      well-thought-out content that prioritises the reader. If you like this website, I’d really appreciate it if you’d consider sending me a donation. Web development is very time consuming, and even a small token of appreciation keeps me motivated
      to continue publishing content. You can either donate via <a href="https://stripe.com/au" target="_blank">Stripe</a> or via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a>, depending on your preference.</p>
