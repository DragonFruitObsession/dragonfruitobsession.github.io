    <p>While dragon fruit are great eaten fresh, itâ€™s always fun to try using them in cooking, especially if you end up with more than you can eat. I like cooking with red-fleshed dragon fruit as the vibrant colour and seeds speckled through make any
      dessert really pop, and the flavour adds yet another element. This page is a refined version of any dragon fruit recipes I consider worth making again, something I have only just begun to tap into.</p>
