    <h2>Dragon Fruit Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to provide an insight into what makes dragon fruit plants come into production, as this is the main reason for growing them. Over the past few years, I have recorded every dragon fruit flower upon opening, although
      it
      was not until 2020 that I had enough flowers (60 in total!) to really see any correlation between weather and flowering times. I chose the opening of dragon fruit flowers as the root of my data as it can easily be recorded with perfect
      accuracy,
      as opposed to buds or new growth which are difficult to see when they are small. However, in the future I hope to expand this section of my website across multiple pages comparing different varieties and the effects of grafting. In any case,
      let’s take a look at the data…</p>
    <img src="Flower Graphs/Monthly Flowers.jpeg" alt="Graph of all monthly flowers" class="img-1">
    <p>The graph to the left gives you a general impression of my fruiting season. I live in Perth, Western Australia, which is in the Southern hemisphere, so Winter goes from June to August with the Winter Solstice on June 21, Spring from September
      to November, Summer from December
      to
      February with the Summer Solstice on December 21, and Autumn from March to May. During Winter, my dragon fruit plants grow very slowly, but do not have to face any frost due to my location. However, cactus rust does seem to spread during this
      time. When it begins to warm up in
      Spring, my dragon fruit plants spring to life putting on lots of new growth before they begin fruit production in Summer. As you can see, my earliest dragon fruit flowers occurred in January and the latest in April, with the majority of
      flowers
      during Summer. The hot weather seems to get rid of the cactus rust and the plants appear much healthier so long as they are somewhat protected from the sun and are well-watered and fertilised.
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the season, I cannot control the weather. However, I can control the amount of water, fertiliser, shading, and pruning I give them. Hopefully the following analysis provides some insight into the correlation between dragon fruit
      flowering and the weather,
      so the factors we can change can be controlled accordingly to try and extend the dragon fruit season both ways. All weather data is taken from the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data-services/station-data.shtml" target="_blank">Australian Bureau of Meteorology Website<a>.</p>

      <h3><u>Flowers vs Temperature (top left)</u></h3>
      <p>Other than more flowers during the warmer times of the year, there doesn’t appear to be a direct correlation between dragon fruit flowers and temperature. However, each peak in flowering seems to coincide with a drop in temperatures. This
        makes sense, because flowers typically abort in extreme heat due to the massive amount of energy needed to produce them proving too much in such temperatures. This timing could be a way of limiting flower abortion and hence increasing the
        chances of producing seeds, which is what the plant wants. Further, flowers stay open longer in cooler temperatures, increasing the chance of pollination.</p>
      <h3><u>Flowers vs Solar Exposure (top right)</u></h3>
      <p>There appears to be a consensus that dragon fruit flowers are linked to the amount of sunlight hours they receive each day, so much so that some farms put up lights to extend the growing season. I chose solar exposure because it measures the
        amount of the sun’s energy that reaches the surface rather than sunlight hours which could prove inaccurate on cloudy days. In any case, there doesn’t appear to be a direct correlation between the two, however, the general trend of solar
        exposure from high to low seems to support the successive flowering cycles. Also like temperature, flowers seem to open during drops in solar exposure, which are most likely for the same reasons.</p>
      <h3><u>Flowers vs Rainfall (bottom left)</u></h3>
      <p>Surprisingly, temperature seems to be the most influential of all factors I have tested, as it fits the flowering cycle almost perfectly. Perth receives very little rain in Summer, so to me it is quite remarkable that the flowers coincide
        with it. This is probably due to similar reasons to temperature. The energy required to produce such enormous blooms requires lots of water, so perhaps this is the plants’ way of making sure they survive the heat. The day or so lag can be
        explained by the need for dry weather when the flower is open, as excess water can wash away the pollen making pollination harder. I will be very interested to see if this trend continues in the years to come.</p>
      <h3><u>Flowers vs Moon Phases (bottom right)</u></h3>
      <p>There seems to be some myth going around that dragon fruit flowers only open on a full moon, perhaps due to the increase in nocturnal pollinators. However, it seems there is no relationship whatsoever between moon phases and dragon fruit
        flowers. I am not sure whether to test this again as it seems like some sort of urban myth.</p>
