    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow the best from cuttings. Look for thick, healthy stems and let them cure in the shade for a week, to prevent rot. Then place a few centimetres deep in some good soil and water well. Don’t
      water again until
      the soil looks dry on top. I find dragon fruit cuttings strike better in small pots, where you can train them up a bamboo stick until they are at least half a metre high, then be transferred to the ground or a much larger pot as their final
      position.
      I would advise against growing dragon fruits from seeds unless you want to create a new hybrid variety or want to graft a hard-to-find variety. Dragon fruit seedlings take a very long time to fruit from seed, sometimes
      up to seven years, although grafting can significantly speed up this process.

    For some varieties, such as Yellow Dragon, it is advisable to graft onto a strong rootstock, such as Isis Gold or Vietnam White, as its own root system is not very strong. Varieties like Yellow Dragon can take a year to get their first
    shoot if you do not graft them, however you can still grow them successfully without grafting. My first graft took only about a month before Yellow Dragon put out a shoot, horizontally grafted to Vietnam White.

    Now, there is (at least) one more method of propagation out there, known as tissue culture, however it can only be done in a lab. Tissue cultured dragon fruit are that grown from a single cell, in a test tube. It is done to produce large quantities of the same plant from a small amount of plant material. This is done in the US with a variety known as Edgar’s Baby.
