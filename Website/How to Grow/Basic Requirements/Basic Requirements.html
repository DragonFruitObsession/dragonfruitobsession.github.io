    <p>Being a tropical cactus, dragon fruit plants prefer a full-sun environment, but may struggle in the middle of summer, depending on the variety and climate. Varieties with Selenicereus DNA, such as Yellow Dragon, seem to be the most sensitive
      to heat and cold.<br><br>
      If your climate gets very hot like where I live (up to 40+ degrees Celsius), some of the branches may turn yellow, which can lead to mush-like burns of rotting flesh. If this happens, cut away the rotting flesh immediately before it spreads and
      clean with a paper towel
      (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf82GzM83Kc" target="_blank">how to do
        this</a>))
      to stop the plant from wasting its energy trying to heal the burns. One option is to grow them in pots
      (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank">
        Spicy Exotics’ trellis design</a>), and simply move
      them in the heat of the summer. If you are planting your dragon fruit plants in the ground and live in a hot climate, think about installing some 30 percent shade cloth for the summer, although make sure it does not actually touch the plants,
      as this could also lead to burning. I would advise against planting in part shade as this could reduce production.<br><br>
      If your climate gets very cold (frost in the winter), your dragon fruit may take on a purple tinge, and excess rain could cause it to rot. Some growers place lights or heat lamps around their dragon fruit and put up a temporary greenhouse to
      keep the heat in and minimise frost.

    <h3><u>Soil:</u></h3>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants thrive in a well-draining, highly organic soil. If you are growing them in pots, get the biggest pot you can find (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank">Spicy Exotics’ trellis
        design</a>)
      and make sure there are plenty of holes in the bottom for drainage. I
      use a 50-50 mix of regular cactus soil and compost, which seems to work well. I have found potting mix is not the best for dragon fruit, as it holds too much water.</p>

      <figcaption>I use lots of organic matter, including lupin mulch.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <h3><u>Water:</u></h3>
    <p>Coming from a tropical environment, dragon fruit plants are unlike most other cacti in that they need regular water. In the heat of summer, water once a day to once every two days and slowly drop down to once or twice a week when it gets
      cooler, in the winter months. It is important to note, some growers comment a period of dryness in Spring can induce budding.</p>

    <h3><u>Fertilising and mulching:</u></h3>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow very fast and resultantly require lots of feeding. To help improve the soil and promote healthy growth, I like to feed my dragon fruit plants with alternating dynamic lifter and general compost, every month or so
      across the whole year. To help with flowering and fruit set, apply sulphate of potash every one-to-two months over the growing season, and water in well. In the hotter months make sure your dragon fruit are well mulched. I like to use woodchips
      for my dragon fruits in the ground and lupin mulch for my pots, as it breaks down more easily.</p>

    <h3><u>Trellising: </u></h3>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants require a strong, sturdy trellis to grow up. Many growers choose to grow them up a pole (usually concrete, wood or PVC pipe) with a top support such as a tire, to let them hang down which stimulates budding and creates the
      typical “umbrella canopy”. Some farms in Vietnam do not use a top support at all, but rather bend the branches to support their own weight (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Xi9PMuwEA" target="_blank">how</a>).
      <br><br>If you are making your trellis out of wood, beware that dragon fruit plants can readily produce for up to 30 years, so make sure it will not rot too quickly (hardwoods are less prone to rot, as are pressure treated woods). I personally
      do not use wood for dragon fruit trellises as I am worried it will rot.<br><br>If you do not want to make your own dragon fruit trellis, you can simply grow them over a fence or fence-like structure. Whatever you choose, make sure it can
      support a few hundred kilograms and allows the plants to hang down. As the plant grows, make sure to prune out any low growth from the main stem, and do not let the canopy become too dense. The following are links to some great dragon fruit
