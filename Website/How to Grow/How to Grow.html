      <h3>Dragon Fruit Growing Tips</h3>
      <p><u>Position: </u></p>
      <p>For the most part, dragon fruit plants prefer a full-sun environment, but provide some shade in the middle of summer. For the small scale gardener, simply throw some burlap over on the hottest days, although putting up a shade cloth might be
        a
        better option if you have lots of dragon fruit plants.</p>
      <p><u>Soil: </u></p>
      <p>Dragon fruit plants thrive in a well-draining, highly organic soil. I use a 50-50 mix of regular cactus soil and compost, which seems to work well. I have found that dragon fruit plants seem to grow better in large pots, as you can make all
        available soil good quality, rather than in the ground where good soil mixes with bad.</p>
      <p><u>Water: </u></p>
      <p>Coming from a tropical environment, dragon fruit plants are unlike most other cacti in that they need regular water. In the heat of summer, water once a day and slowly drop down to once or twice a week when it gets cooler, in the winter
        months.</p>
      <p><u>Fertilising and mulching: </u></p>
      <p>Dragon fruit plants grow very fast and resultantly require lots of feeding. To help improve the soil and promote healthy growth, I like to feed my dragon fruit plants with alternating dynamic lifter and general compost, every month or so
        across the whole year. To help with flowering and fruit set, apply sulphate of potash every one-to-two months over the growing season, and water in well. In the hotter months make sure your dragon fruit are well mulched.</p>
      <p><u>Trellising: </u></p>
      <p>Dragon fruit require a strong, sturdy trellis to grow up. Many growers choose to grow them up a pole with a top support, to let them hang down, which stimulates budding. Other growers choose to grow them over a fence-like structure, which
        also
        helps them to bend down. Whatever you choose, make sure it can support a few hundred kilograms. As the plant grows, make sure to prune out any low growth bar the main stem, and don't let the canopy become too dense. The following are links to
        some great dragon fruit trellis tutorials:</p>
