    <h3>Dragon Fruit Growing Tips</h3>
    <p><u>Position:</u></p>
    <p>Being a tropical cactus, dragon fruit plants prefer a full-sun environment, but may struggle in the middle of summer, depending on the variety and climate. If this is the case, some of the branches may turn yellow, which can lead to mush-like burns of rotting flesh. If this happens, cut away the rotting flesh immediately before it spreads, and to stop the plant from wasting energy into healing (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf82GzM83Kc" target="_blank">how to do this</a>). One option is to grow them in pots (see<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank"> Spicy Exotics’ trellis design</a>), and simply move them in the heat of the summer. If you are
      planting your dragon fruit plants in the ground and live in a hot
      climate, think about installing some shade cloth for the summer, although make sure it doesn’t actually touch the plants, as this could also lead to burning. I would advise against planting in part shade as this could reduce production.</p>
    <p id="soil"><u>Soil:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants thrive in a well-draining, highly organic soil. If you are growing them in pots, get the biggest pot you can find (see<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank"> Spicy Exotics’ trellis design</a>)
      and make sure there are plenty of holes in the bottom for drainage. I
      use a 50-50 mix of regular cactus soil and compost, which seems to work well. I have found potting mix is not the best for dragon fruit, as it holds too much water.</p>
    <p><u>Water:</u></p>
    <p>Coming from a tropical environment, dragon fruit plants are unlike most other cacti in that they need regular water. In the heat of summer, water once a day to once every two days and slowly drop down to once or twice a week when it gets
      cooler, in the winter months. It is important to note, some growers comment a period of dryness in Spring can induce budding.</p>
    <p><u>Propagation:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow the best from cuttings. Look for thick, healthy stems and let them cure in the shade for a week, to prevent rot. Then place a few centimetres deep in some good soil (see<a href="#soil"> soil</a>), and water well. Don’t
      water again until
      the soil looks dry on top. I find dragon fruit cuttings strike better in small pots, where you can train them up a bamboo stick until they are at least half a metre high, then be transferred to the ground or a much larger pot as their final
      position.
      I would advise against growing dragon fruits from seeds unless you want to create a new hybrid variety or want to graft a hard-to-find variety. Dragon fruit seedlings take a very long time to fruit from seed, sometimes
      up to seven years, although grafting can significantly speed up this process. See below for a great tutorial on dragon fruit seedling grafts:</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyyhYvnMrY" target="_blank">Grafting Dragon Fruits' Seedling Graft Tutorial</a>
    <p><u>Fertilising and mulching:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow very fast and resultantly require lots of feeding. To help improve the soil and promote healthy growth, I like to feed my dragon fruit plants with alternating dynamic lifter and general compost, every month or so
      across the whole year. To help with flowering and fruit set, apply sulphate of potash every one-to-two months over the growing season, and water in well. In the hotter months make sure your dragon fruit are well mulched.</p>
    <p><u>Trellising: </u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit require a strong, sturdy trellis to grow up. Many growers choose to grow them up a pole with a top support, to let them hang down, which stimulates budding. Other growers choose to grow them over a fence-like structure, which
      also
      helps them to bend down. Whatever you choose, make sure it can support a few hundred kilograms. As the plant grows, make sure to prune out any low growth from the main stem, and don't let the canopy become too dense. The following are links
      to
      some great dragon fruit trellis tutorials:</p>

    <p><u>Pollination and flowers:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants have some of the most impressive flowers in the cacti family. These flowers open at night and close early in the morning, so natural pollinators include moths, bats, bees, and ants. They can be either self-pollinating,
      self-fertile or self-sterile, depending on the variety. If your variety is self-pollinating, the stigma will be very short, and close to the anthers, so no hand pollination is required, although this could increase fruit-set and size.
      Self-fertile varieties, on the other hand, usually have a slightly longer stigma, so the flower may need some assistance for successful pollination (see <a href="#hand-pollination">below</a>), especially if you don’t have many natural pollinators. Lastly, self-sterile, or
      cross-pollinating varieties usually have a very long stigma that protrudes well away from the anthers. You will need to collect pollen from another variety for fruit to set (see <a href="#Storing-pollen">below</a>), as its own pollen is not capable of pollinating its own flower.
      Planting many varieties can help alleviate this problem if you have lots of natural pollinators, although flowers do not always open on the same night, in which case you will either have to refrigerate or freeze pollen from other varieties.</p>

    <h3 id="hand-pollination">How to Hand Pollinate Your Dragon Fruit Flowers</h3>
    <div class="pollen">

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 1
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 1.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you dragon fruit flower is near fully opened (around 10pm for me), grab a fine brush (I like to use a makeup brush) and rub the bristles against the anthers, which are the male parts of the flower that produce pollen. I would recommend
          doing this during the night rather than during the morning, as this could result in smaller fruit.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 2

          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 2.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Check to see there is sufficient pollen on the brush. You may need to rub harder (don't be too gentle, some people cut the anthers off altogether!). The more pollen you can get, the better chance your flower has of pollinating and producing
          a large fruit.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 3

          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 3.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Now, rub all that pollen on the stigma, which is the female part of the flower protruding from the anthers. Make sure to coat the entire sitgma as best you can, and repeat several times, as this is where pollination takes place. Without it,
          no fruit can form.

        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you dragon fruit flower is near fully opened (around 10pm for me), grab a wide bowl and place it inside the flower, under the bottom-most anthers. Then, rub the back-end of a fine brush (I like to use a makeup brush) against the
          anthers so the pollen collects in the bowl. To ensure fruit set, make sure to hand pollinate the flower (see <a href="#hand-pollination">hand pollination</a>), as you have taken most of the pollen from the flower.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 2
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 2.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you have finished collecting pollen, let the pollen dry out for 24 hours. This step is very important, as any moisture will cause the pollen to become unviable. I like to clump the pollen together by shaking the bowl, so I don't lose
          any.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 3
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 3.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          I use 1.5 micro tubes to store the pollen, although any air-tight container should do the job. In order to get the pollen into the micro tube, fold a small piece of paper in half as a pourer. Shake the pollen to unclump it, then pour onto
          the paper over another bowl so you don't lose any pollen. Then use the paper to direct the pollen into the micro tube, sealing when you are done.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 4
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 4.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Next, label the micro tube with variety (abbreviation) and date, by folding a piece of masking tape around the micro tube. Some varieties aren't compatible, and older pollen is less viable, so labelling will help you use the right pollen in
          the right order.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 5
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 5.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Now, place the micro tube inside a zip-lock bag (make sure it is freezer safe), with at least two silica packs (re-cycle from other products). This will help keep moisture away from the pollen. Make sure to get all the air out of the
          zip-lock bag and seal it well.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 6
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 6.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Repeat step five with another zip-lock bag, and one more silica pack, to keep the moisture out. Then simply leave it in the freezer. You can add as many micro tubes as you like to the internal bag, and defrost one at a time (oldest first)
          when you need it. The pollen should stay viable for 1-2 years, although that is an area I have not yet tested.
