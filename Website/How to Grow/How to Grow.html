    <h3>Dragon Fruit Growing Tips</h3>
    <p><u>Position:</u></p>
    <p>Being a tropical cactus, dragon fruit plants prefer a full-sun environment, but may struggle in the middle of summer, depending on the variety and climate. If this is the case, some of the branches may turn yellow, which can lead to mush-like
      burns which may need to be chopped off. One option is to grow them in pots (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank">see Spicy Exotics’ trellis design</a>), and simply move them in the heat of the summer. If you are planting your dragon fruit plants in the ground and live in a hot
      climate, think about installing some shade cloth for the summer, although make sure it doesn’t actually touch the plants, as this could also lead to burning. I would advise against planting in part shade as this could reduce production.</p>
    <p id="soil"><u>Soil:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants thrive in a well-draining, highly organic soil. If you are growing them in pots, get the biggest pot you can find (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfM2D5r3H40" target="_blank">see Spicy Exotics’ trellis design</a>) and make sure there are plenty of holes in the bottom for drainage. I
      use a 50-50 mix of regular cactus soil and compost, which seems to work well. I have found potting mix is not the best for dragon fruit, as it holds too much water.</p>
    <p><u>Water:</u></p>
    <p>Coming from a tropical environment, dragon fruit plants are unlike most other cacti in that they need regular water. In the heat of summer, water once a day to once every two days and slowly drop down to once or twice a week when it gets
      cooler, in the winter months. It is important to note, some growers comment a period of dryness in Spring can induce budding.</p>
    <p><u>Propagation:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow the best from cuttings. Look for thick, healthy stems and let them cure in the shade for a week, to prevent rot. Then place a few centimetres deep in some good soil (<a href="#soil">see soil</a>), and water well. Don’t water again until
      the soil looks dry on top. I find dragon fruit cuttings strike better in small pots, where you can train them up a bamboo stick until they are at least half a metre high, then be transferred to the ground or a much larger pot as their final
      position.
      I would advise against growing dragon fruits from seeds unless you want to create a new hybrid variety or want to graft a hard-to-find variety. Dragon fruit seedlings take a very long time to fruit from seed, sometimes
      up to seven years, although grafting can significantly speed up this process. See below for a great tutorial on dragon fruit seedling grafts:</p>

    <p><u>Fertilising and mulching:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants grow very fast and resultantly require lots of feeding. To help improve the soil and promote healthy growth, I like to feed my dragon fruit plants with alternating dynamic lifter and general compost, every month or so
      across the whole year. To help with flowering and fruit set, apply sulphate of potash every one-to-two months over the growing season, and water in well. In the hotter months make sure your dragon fruit are well mulched.</p>
    <p><u>Trellising: </u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit require a strong, sturdy trellis to grow up. Many growers choose to grow them up a pole with a top support, to let them hang down, which stimulates budding. Other growers choose to grow them over a fence-like structure, which
      also
      helps them to bend down. Whatever you choose, make sure it can support a few hundred kilograms. As the plant grows, make sure to prune out any low growth from the main stem, and don't let the canopy become too dense. The following are links

    <p><u>Pollination and flowers:</u></p>
    <p>Dragon fruit plants have some of the most impressive flowers in the cacti family. These flowers open at night and close early in the morning, so natural pollinators include moths, bats, bees, and ants. They can be either self-pollinating,
      self-fertile or self-sterile, depending on the variety. If your variety is self-pollinating, the stigma will be very short, and close to the anthers, so no hand pollination is required, although this could increase fruit-set and size.
      Self-fertile varieties, on the other hand, usually have a slightly longer stigma, so the flower may need some assistance for successful pollination, especially if you don’t have many natural pollinators. Lastly, self-sterile, or
      cross-pollinating varieties usually have a very long stigma that protrudes well away from the anthers. You will need to collect pollen from another variety for fruit to set, as its own pollen is not capable of pollinating its own flower.
      Planting many varieties can help alleviate this problem if you have lots of natural pollinators, although flowers do not always open on the same night, in which case you will either have to refrigerate or freeze pollen from other varieties.</p>
