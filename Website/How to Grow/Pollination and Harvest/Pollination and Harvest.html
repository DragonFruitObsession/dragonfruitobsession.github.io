    <h3><u>Pollination and flowers:</u></h3>

    </div>

    <p>Dragon fruit plants have some of the most impressive flowers in the cacti family. These flowers open at night and close early in the morning, so natural pollinators include moths, bats, bees, and ants. They can be either self-pollinating,
      self-fertile or self-sterile, depending on the variety.<br><br>
      If your variety is self-pollinating, the stigma will be very short, and close to the anthers, so no hand pollination is required, although this could increase fruit-set and size.
      <br><br>
      Self-fertile varieties, on the other hand, usually have a slightly longer stigma, so the flower may need some assistance for successful pollination (see <a href="#hand-pollination">below</a>), especially if you donâ€™t have many natural
      pollinators.<br><br>
      Lastly, self-sterile, or
      cross-pollinating varieties usually have a very long stigma that protrudes well away from the anthers. You will need to collect pollen from another variety for fruit to set (see <a href="#Storing-pollen">below</a>), as its own pollen is not
      capable of pollinating its own flower.
      Planting many varieties can help alleviate this problem if you have lots of natural pollinators, although flowers do not always open on the same night, in which case you will either have to refrigerate or freeze pollen from other varieties.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Harvesting:</u></h3>
    <p>Upon successful pollination, the flower will shrivel up and the fruit grow. This flower can be removed after a week or so, and doing so can get rid of unwanted pests from your fruit. For most varieties, your dragon fruits will be ripe after 30
      to 40 days in summer, although most with Selenicereus DNA will take much longer (up to six months). You will know the fruit is ready when the colour has almost fully changed, it feels loose like a loose tooth, and if it cracks (possibly
      overipe).</p>

    <h2 id="hand-pollination">How to Hand Pollinate Your Dragon Fruit Flowers</h2>
    <div class="pollen">

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 1
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 1.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you dragon fruit flower is near fully opened (around 10pm for me), grab a fine brush (I like to use a makeup brush) and rub the bristles against the anthers, which are the male parts of the flower that produce pollen. I would recommend
          doing this during the night rather than during the morning, as this could result in smaller fruit.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 2
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 2.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Check to see there is sufficient pollen on the brush. You may need to rub harder (don't be too gentle, some people cut the anthers off altogether!). The more pollen you can get, the better chance your flower has of pollinating and producing
          a large fruit.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 3
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Hand Pollination - Step 3.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Now, rub all that pollen on the stigma, which is the female part of the flower protruding from the anthers. Make sure to coat the entire sitgma as best you can, and repeat several times, as this is where pollination takes place. Without it,
          no fruit can form.

        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 1.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you dragon fruit flower is near fully opened (around 10pm for me), grab a wide bowl and place it inside the flower, under the bottom-most anthers. Then, rub the back-end of a fine brush (I like to use a makeup brush) against the
          anthers so the pollen collects in the bowl. To ensure fruit set, make sure to hand pollinate the flower (see <a href="#hand-pollination">hand pollination</a>), as you have taken most of the pollen from the flower.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 2
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 2.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          When you have finished collecting pollen, let the pollen dry out for 24 hours. This step is very important, as any moisture will cause the pollen to become unviable. I like to clump the pollen together by shaking the bowl, so I don't lose
          any.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 3
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 3.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          I use 1.5 micro tubes to store the pollen, although any air-tight container should do the job. In order to get the pollen into the micro tube, fold a small piece of paper in half as a pourer. Shake the pollen to unclump it, then pour onto
          the paper over another bowl so you don't lose any pollen. Then use the paper to direct the pollen into the micro tube, sealing when you are done.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 4
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 4.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Next, label the micro tube with variety (abbreviation) and date, by folding a piece of masking tape around the micro tube. Some varieties aren't compatible, and older pollen is less viable, so labelling will help you use the right pollen in
          the right order.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 5
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 5.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Now, place the micro tube inside a zip-lock bag (make sure it is freezer safe), with at least two silica packs (re-cycle from other products). This will help keep moisture away from the pollen. Make sure to get all the air out of the
          zip-lock bag and seal it well.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <div class="step-label">Step 6
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="Pollination Photos/Storing Pollen - Step 6.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
          Repeat step five with another zip-lock bag, and one more silica pack, to keep the moisture out. Then simply leave it in the freezer. You can add as many micro tubes as you like to the internal bag, and defrost one at a time (oldest first)
          when you need it. The pollen should stay viable for 1-2 years, although that is an area I have not yet tested.
