            <p>Average brix: 12.5 (Average of 1) <br>Average Mass: 554 grams (Average of 2) <br>Pollination type: <a href="../How to Grow/Pollination and Harvest/Pollination and Harvest.html">Self Pollinating</a></p>
            <p>This variety, as can probably be inferred from the name, is the common red-fleshed variety. It is known to be high in antioxidents, and has a refreshing taste when chilled. Under the right conditions, growth is very thick, and can get
              up
              to around 10 centimetres in thickness. Flowers are self-fertile, and probably self-pollinating (untested).<br><br>Although this variety is a fast grower, it is more susceptible to sun burn and cactus rust than other varietes such as Vietnam White 2.

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>This variety buds late into the season, sometimes even producing winter fruits. The buds have lots of sap which the ants just go crazy over, although it doesn't seem to stunt the buds too much. As with most red-fleshed varieties, the
              buds have red tips.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>This variety has a pretty standard flower when compared to other varieties. The stigma protrudes slightly away from the anthers, however, which could make self-pollination less effective.</p>
            <p>Common Red produces abundent pollen which could be used to cross-pollinate other varieties, although that is an area I have not yet tested.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>The fruits of common red are quite large upon successful pollination. In the ripening process, the tips of the fins turn red first, followed by the rest of the fruit. Like most red-fleshed varieties, the fruits should be left to split
              before picking for the best flavour.</p>
