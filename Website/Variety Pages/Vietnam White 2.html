            <p>To be honest, I am a little disappointed with this variety. It tastes just like any regular white variety, but it won't set fruit with its own pollen. It seems a bit of a painful process to go through just to get more white-fleshed fruits. In saying this, however, cross pollination usually results in larger fruits. <br><br>This variety grows relatively fast when compared to my other variety of Vietnam White, and the Common Red cultivar. Like most dragon fruits, it is susceptible to sunburn so some 30% shade cloth should do the trick.

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>This variety buds profusely when the conditions are right, although I am not sure if they will all set fruit. Buds seem most prominent in the middle of summer. They start off pale yellow than mature into the "firebomb" shown in the third picture.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>The flowers of the round cultivar of Vietnam White are, to say the least, beautiful. The massive blooms have the typical succulent scent, which seems to attract bees from far and wide. The stigma protudes slightly away from the anthers, which don't contain a whole lot of pollen when compared to other, common cultivars.</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>My first fruiting cycle I got a huge range of fruit sizes, from 100 grams to 600 grams plus! However, I have only included the large fruits in the "average mass" as I believe the small fruits were not properly pollinated (I didn't know it would be self-sterile). Other than that, the fruits are pretty regular in the ripening process, although they seem to take quite a while to reach full sweetness (45+ days).</p>
