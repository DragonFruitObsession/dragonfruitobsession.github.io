    <h2>Origami</h2>
    <p>In addition to dragon fruit, I am also a keen origamist (I like to fold things out of paper). So, on this page I have decided to merge my two hobbies together, in what I like to call dragon fruit origami. Below are all my origami dragon fruit
      desings. I'll add crease patterns (blueprints of origami) soon in case anyone wants to give them a try.

        <h3>Dragon Fruit Skin</h3>
        <p>This design incorporates a colour change derived from the square base in origami. You can obviously mix and match colours to your desiring.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Palora Dragon Fruit</h3>
        <p>This is a geometric representation of the Palora (giant thorny yellow) dragon fruit. It is derived from an axonometric (equalateral triangle) grid.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Dragon Fruit Cutting</h3>
        <p>This design requires a 2 by 1 rectangle, and fits a regular square grid. You could make it longer if you wanted but it would get increasingly tricky as you couldn't reach the middle.</p>
