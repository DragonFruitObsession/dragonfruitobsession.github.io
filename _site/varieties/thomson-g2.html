            <p>This variety is very similar to <a href="../varieties/american-beauty.html">American Beauty</a>, though it is probably self-sterile (I haven’t tested yet, but most sources report as self-sterile). Some people even claim them to be the
              same, though I believe there are several
              American Beauties going around and the bracts remain green on the one I have, unlike G2. Regardless, they both display the characteristic rib pattern of the guatemalensis species, though I find it is more exaggerated in G2. Like so many of the great varieties, G2 was collected by Paul Thomson. The fruit is
              a nice round shape with a vibrant pink flesh. Although it has a reasonable sweetness, what makes this variety is the complexity of flavour, reminiscent of berries and melons. It’s worth having, though I do prefer some of the sweeter
              varieties like <a href="../varieties/sugar-dragon.html">Sugar Dragon</a> and <a href="../varieties/purple-haze.html">Purple Haze</a>.

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>Like American Beauty, G2 is one of the first to bud, and can do so at a relatively small size (see picture of the full plant). When the buds first pop out, they exhibit a reddish-brown tinge that disappears as it develops. The sepals
              develop a yellowy outline which distinguishes it from the red outline of American Beauty, though the opening flower is very similar.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>
            <p>As you might expect, the flowers of G2 are like that of American Beauty, a little smaller than average, but otherwise standard. The stigma is close to the anthers which indicates it may have some self-fertility, though I have not
              tested this as most sources say otherwise (but not all). Once I get some more flowers, I might be willing to potentially sacrifice one to see for myself.

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>Upon successful pollination, a nice round fruit forms at the base. Once again, this is like American Beauty, but a major difference is that the bracts change colour, as opposed to staying green. The outside colour of the fruit is not
              particularly vibrant, so you might be tempted to wait longer than necessary to harvest. It is ready when it wiggles freely and most of the green is gone.</p>
