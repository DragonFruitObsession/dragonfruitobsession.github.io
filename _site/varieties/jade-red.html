            <p>This variety is quite new to the dragon fruiting world and was developed right here in Australia. It is a cross between the red-fleshed <i>Hylocereus polyrhizus</i>, and an unknown epiphyllum (<i>Hylocereeae sp.</i>). This not only
              breaks the definition of a species (i.e., can successfully interbreed to produce live, fertile offspring), but does this across different genera. What makes it even more remarkable is that it is one of the few, coloured-flower dragon
              fruit varieties that produces reasonable size, great-tasting fruit. From my single taste test so far, the fruit is incredibly juicy and sweet, spurting out berry flavours as it melts in your mouth<br><br>This variety is a fast grower,
              but does not have the thickest of stems. It seems to tolerate the sun and cold reasonably well. If you can get your hands on this variety, do not hesitate to do so.</p>

            <h3>Buds</h3>
            <p>I have only had two buds so far, and one aborted early, but they came before the plant was even thirteen months old from a cutting! This is incredibly quick when compared to other varieties which can take multiple years before they begin
              fruiting.<br><br>To start with, the buds are not much different to that of Common Red, aside from the purple tips instead of red tips. However, the later stages of bud development set it firmly apart. Slowly the purple petals begin to
              show themselves, bursting out of the top of the bud, before finally exploding into the flower.</p>

            <h3>Flowers</h3>
            <p>Jade Red has a stunning purple flower that makes it worth your effort even without the fruit. While some sources say Jade Red is self-pollinating, the limited amount of pollen produced by the flower, and the fact that it is a hybrid,
              make it much safer to cross pollinate. My guess is that without human intervention, a very small percentage of flowers will set, and the fruit will be of low quality.<br><br>Another interesting aspect of the flower is that it opens
              unusually early for dragon fruit – around 5pm – perhaps due to its epiphyllum half. That is why my night flower picture is to the right of the day picture; by 7am in the morning the flower was nearly fully closed (the flower on the left is before fully opening, preceeding the night flower).</p>

            <h3>Fruit</h3>
            <p>As I have only had one fruit from this plant, I can’t conclude too much about fruit size. While my fruit was around 200 grams, many other people have had much larger fruit, easily double that size. This is what makes it a desirable
              over most other coloured-flower dragon fruit varieties which have very small fruits. Hopefully this proves true in my case.<br><br>The ripening process is like that of <a href="../varieties/common-red.html">Common Red</a>, although it seems to hold its colour much longer without
              splitting.</p>
